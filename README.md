Make sure you have installed Nvidia driver (version > 530) and CUDA (version > 12). It may be a lot easier to just use Windows with WSL, as there is an existing [Pre-built Windows Binaries](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-built-windows-binaries). But you can still follow this if you are using ubuntu 22.04 (or anyother docker compatible linux distro)
