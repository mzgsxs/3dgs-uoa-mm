# Improvements on Dynamic 3D-Gaussians: Tracking by Persistent Dynamic View Synthesis by Luiten et al.

## Environment Setup
To set up the environment, please follow the instructions in [dynamic-3dgs-tutorial.md](https://github.com/mzgsxs/3dgs-uoa-mm/blob/main/dynamic-3dgs-tutorial.md).

After environment setup, switch to one of the following branches to view changes. 

## Segmentation
Code for segmentation using LTS and SAM-2 can be found on the [ksha2-segmentcodes](https://github.com/mzgsxs/3dgs-uoa-mm/tree/ksha2-segmentcodes) branch. 

Code for training with "soft" segmentation masks and new loss functions can be found on the [d3dgs-soft-bg](https://github.com/mzgsxs/3dgs-uoa-mm/tree/d3dgs-soft-bg) branch. 

All code is adapted from the original repository by Luiten et. al. on Dynamic 3D Gaussians. [Github Repo](https://github.com/JonathonLuiten/Dynamic3DGaussians). 

For more details, please refer to the accompanying paper: "Improvements on Dynamic 3D-Gaussians: Tracking by Persistent Dynamic View Synthesis by Luiten et al.".
